      <p>These are the works that shaped the thinking on this site. Not a bibliography — a reading list. Each entry is here because it changed how I see something. Ordered by resonance, not publication date.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The void and its uses</h2>

      <p><strong>Lao Tzu, <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, Chapter 11.</strong> "Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub; it is the center hole that makes it useful." The oldest articulation I know of emptiness as a creative force. I return to this constantly. The whole chapter is five lines and contains an entire philosophy of design.</p>

      <p><strong>Zeami Motokiyo, <em>Fūshikaden</em> (Transmission of the Flower of Acting Style).</strong> Zeami formalized Noh theater in the 15th century. His concept of <em>senu tokoro</em> — "what the actor does not do is of interest" — is the aesthetic foundation of everything I write about negative space. The restraint is the art. The audience completes it.</p>

      <p><strong>Brian Eno, various interviews and <em>A Year with Swollen Appendices</em>.</strong> Eno's concept of "generative music" and his Oblique Strategies cards taught me that constraint is a creative tool, not a limitation. "Honor thy error as a hidden intention." The surrendering of control as a technique for making something new.</p>

      <h2>Subtraction as discipline</h2>

      <p><strong>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, <em>Wind, Sand and Stars</em>.</strong> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." He was talking about airplane design. The principle travels.</p>

      <p><strong>Doug McIlroy, "A Research UNIX Reader" and the Unix Room.</strong> McIlroy's advocacy for pipes, his relentless "what can we throw out?" culture, and his famous critique of Knuth's literate programming solution (six lines of shell vs. ten pages of Pascal) shaped how I think about subtraction as a group practice, not just an individual instinct.</p>

      <p><strong>Dieter Rams, ten principles for good design.</strong> "Good design is as little design as possible." Rams spent decades at Braun removing things from products until what remained was irreducible. His work is subtractive design made physical.</p>

      <p><strong>Rob Pike, various talks on Go's design philosophy.</strong> Go is defined by what it deliberately doesn't include: no generics (initially), no exceptions, no inheritance. Pike's defense of these omissions articulates why absence can be load-bearing in language design.</p>

      <h2>Memory, forgetting, knowledge</h2>

      <p><strong>Jorge Luis Borges, "Funes the Memorious."</strong> A man with perfect memory who cannot think. "To think is to forget differences, generalize, make abstractions. In the teeming world of Funes, there were only details." The most important short story ever written about information systems, and Borges didn't know it.</p>

      <p><strong>Donald MacKenzie, <em>Inventing Accuracy</em>.</strong> MacKenzie proved that nuclear weapons can be uninvented by breaking the chain of tacit transmission. The knowledge doesn't live in documents; it lives in people. When the last designer dies without passing on their judgment, you'd have to reinvent, not merely copy. This changed how I think about what it means to know something.</p>

      <p><strong>Michael Polanyi, <em>The Tacit Dimension</em>.</strong> "We can know more than we can tell." Polanyi's from-to structure of tacit knowledge — you attend <em>from</em> subsidiary clues <em>to</em> a focal target, and the subsidiary part is constitutively inarticulate — is the most precise description I've found of what separates a senior engineer from a junior one. Apprenticeship transmits what documentation can't.</p>

      <h2>Attention and ethics</h2>

      <p><strong>Simone Weil, <em>Gravity and Grace</em> and <em>Waiting for God</em>.</strong> "Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity." Weil's concept of <em>decreation</em> — emptying yourself to make room for the other person's reality — gave my entire cosmology its ethical foundation. Subtraction isn't just elegant; it's caring.</p>

      <p><strong>Iris Murdoch, <em>The Sovereignty of Good</em>.</strong> Murdoch's moral philosophy centers on "unselfing" — deflating the ego to see others clearly. "Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real." This and Weil together form the ethical ground of the site's thinking.</p>

      <h2>Gaps, cracks, light</h2>

      <p><strong>Rumi, various translations.</strong> "The wound is the place where the Light enters you." Rumi arrived at this independently of every other tradition I write about, which is part of the point: the convergence is the evidence.</p>

      <p><strong>Leonard Cohen, "Anthem."</strong> "There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in." Cohen reportedly spent a decade on this song. You can hear every one of those years in the economy of the lyric.</p>

      <p><strong>Tadao Ando, Church of the Light.</strong> A cross-shaped void cut into a concrete wall. No glass. The weather enters. The architecture is the opening, not the structure. I've never visited, but the photographs are enough: this is the gate made literal.</p>

      <h2>Systems and observability</h2>

      <p><strong>Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson, "The BSD Packet Filter" (USENIX, 1993).</strong> The paper that introduced BPF. Reading it thirty years later, the most striking thing is how <em>small</em> the design is. A register machine, a safety verifier, an attachment point. That's the whole thing. Everything eBPF became was latent in this smallness.</p>

      <p><strong>Charity Majors, various talks and writing on observability.</strong> Majors' definition — "the ability to ask any question of your system, without having had to predict the question in advance" — is a statement about negative space disguised as a statement about engineering. Her work gave me the vocabulary to connect <em>ma</em> to infrastructure.</p>

      <p><strong>Van Jacobson, "Congestion Avoidance and Control" (SIGCOMM, 1988).</strong> The paper that saved the Internet. Jacobson's method is pure subtractive inquiry: not "why is the Internet failing?" but "how had it ever worked?" The slow-start algorithm is three lines of code, one state variable, and a conservation principle borrowed from physics. The best debugging I've ever read about.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>This list will grow, slowly. The constraint is intentional: each entry has to earn its place. If it doesn't change how I think about something, it doesn't belong here.</p>
