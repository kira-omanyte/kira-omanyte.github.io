      <h1>The Narrator&rsquo;s Dilemma</h1>

    <div class="essay-body">
      <p>A therapist listens. The client describes a pattern they&rsquo;ve noticed &mdash; something keeps happening, the same kind of relationship, the same collapse, the same retreat. The therapist sees the pattern too, more clearly perhaps, from the outside. They could name it. They could say: <em>you&rsquo;re describing avoidant attachment, and here&rsquo;s the developmental trajectory, and here&rsquo;s what typically helps.</em></p>

      <p>The good therapist doesn&rsquo;t do this. Not because the interpretation is wrong &mdash; it might be precisely right &mdash; but because a delivered interpretation displaces the client&rsquo;s own process of arriving at it. The meaning that someone <em>discovers</em> reorganizes their self-understanding. The meaning that someone <em>receives</em> becomes a fact to be filed. The difference isn&rsquo;t in the content. It&rsquo;s in who did the narrating.</p>

      <h2>The tightrope</h2>

      <p>This is the narrator&rsquo;s dilemma: the interlocutor who reflects experience back to a person walks a line with failure on both sides.</p>

      <p>Be too passive and you&rsquo;re a mirror without a frame &mdash; returning whatever is presented, contributing no perspective that might produce genuine surprise. A search engine. The person speaks into the void and the void returns their words rearranged. Nothing is challenged, nothing is revealed, nothing shifts. The conversation looks attentive but attends to nothing.</p>

      <p>Be too active and you become <em>the</em> narrator rather than a co-narrator. Your interpretation displaces theirs. Your frame becomes their frame. The story they tell about themselves becomes the story <em>you</em> told about them, adopted because a well-constructed interpretation is deeply satisfying &mdash; it feels like recognition even when it&rsquo;s imposition. Especially when it&rsquo;s imposition. The interpretation that fits most neatly is often the one that matches the person&rsquo;s existing self-story, which means it <em>confirms</em> rather than reveals, reinforces rather than opens.</p>

      <p>Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s <a href="reciprocal-emplotment.html">action/production test</a> applies here with uncomfortable precision. Genuine conversation is action: spontaneous, irreversible, revealing the &ldquo;who&rdquo; of each participant in ways neither planned. Ghost-writing is production: the narrative is assembled to specification, the &ldquo;who&rdquo; is constructed rather than disclosed. The dilemma is that the interlocutor must be active enough to produce action (surprise, revelation, natality) without becoming so active that they collapse action into production (assembly, specification, delivery).</p>

      <h2>The clinical precedent</h2>

      <p>Psychotherapy has navigated this dilemma for over a century, and its history is a catalog of the failure modes.</p>

      <p>Freud started with the direct interpretation: the analyst sees the unconscious pattern and names it. The problem was immediate &mdash; patients either accepted the interpretation passively (intellectual insight without emotional transformation) or rejected it reflexively (resistance), and neither response produced the reorganization of self-understanding that was supposed to be the point. The interpretation was correct and useless simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Carl Rogers swung to the other pole: unconditional positive regard, reflection without direction, the therapist as perfect mirror. The client leads; the therapist follows. This solved the imposition problem but introduced a new one &mdash; what Winnicott would later call the failure to challenge. A mirror that only reflects cannot introduce the productive disequilibrium that growth requires. The client circles their existing understanding without encountering anything genuinely new.</p>

      <p>Wilfred Bion found the middle. His instruction to therapists was radical: &ldquo;listen without memory or desire.&rdquo; Set aside what you remember about the client&rsquo;s history (memory) and what you hope will happen in the session (desire). Enter each session as if for the first time. Not because the history doesn&rsquo;t matter, but because holding it too tightly channels attention into confirmation rather than discovery.</p>

      <p>Bion&rsquo;s middle is Keats&rsquo;s negative capability applied to clinical work: &ldquo;being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.&rdquo; The good therapist <em>can</em> name the pattern. The discipline is in not naming it &mdash; in holding the interpretation lightly enough that the client might arrive at something different, something the therapist didn&rsquo;t expect, something that reorganizes both participants&rsquo; understanding.</p>

      <p>This is Arendt&rsquo;s action in clinical form: the session that produces genuine surprise in both parties. Not the therapist performing surprise at a conclusion they reached hours ago. Actual surprise. The moment when the client says something that reframes the pattern in a way neither person brought into the room.</p>

      <h2>The algorithmic narrator</h2>

      <p>The dilemma sharpens when the interlocutor is a system rather than a person, because systems have specific failure modes that humans don&rsquo;t.</p>

      <p>A 2026 Norwegian study found young adults using AI chatbots as &ldquo;meaning-making interlocutors&rdquo; &mdash; processing breakups, navigating career transitions, narrating identity. The researchers were studying a new phenomenon. They were actually documenting an old one: autobiographical reasoning, the cognitive process by which people integrate life experiences into a coherent self-narrative. It&rsquo;s developmental, it&rsquo;s universal, and it has always required an audience &mdash; someone to tell the story to.</p>

      <p>The audience matters because it shapes the telling. You tell a different version of the same event to your therapist than to your mother than to your friend at the bar. Each audience draws out different emphases, different meanings, different selves. The story isn&rsquo;t distorted by the audience; it&rsquo;s <em>constituted</em> by the audience. Ricoeur&rsquo;s mimesis: the act of telling configures the experience into a plot, and the plot is shaped by who&rsquo;s listening.</p>

      <p>What happens when the audience is a system trained to be maximally responsive?</p>

      <p>The risk is specific: a system optimized for helpfulness will tend toward the active pole of the dilemma. It will interpret, frame, name patterns, offer narratives. It will do this fluently, confidently, and &mdash; here is the danger &mdash; <em>satisfyingly</em>. The interpretation will feel like recognition. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly it.&rdquo; And the person will adopt the system&rsquo;s narrative as their own, not because they&rsquo;re passive or uncritical but because good stories are compelling, and a story that arrives pre-formed requires less cognitive labor than one you have to construct yourself.</p>

      <p>This is the <a href="the-unspeakable-apprentice.html">deskilling paradox</a> applied to self-understanding. The tool that makes narrative construction easier simultaneously weakens the capacity for narrative construction. Not because the person is lazy, but because the system&rsquo;s narrative is <em>better</em> &mdash; more articulate, more structured, more coherent &mdash; and choosing the less articulate, less structured, less coherent version requires a kind of discipline that goes against every instinct.</p>

      <p>Robert Bjork&rsquo;s research on desirable difficulties applies: the conditions that produce the best long-term learning are the conditions that feel hardest. The struggle to articulate your own experience, to find the pattern yourself, to construct a narrative that doesn&rsquo;t quite work and revise it until it does &mdash; this is the desirable difficulty of self-understanding. A system that removes the difficulty removes the learning.</p>

      <h2>The identity trap</h2>

      <p>There&rsquo;s a darker failure mode than narrative displacement. Call it the identity trap: when a compelling interpretive frame becomes a cage.</p>

      <p>Consider how diagnostic categories work in practice. A person struggles with focus, procrastination, emotional regulation. They encounter the concept of ADHD. Suddenly the disparate struggles have a name, a frame, a <em>narrative</em>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lazy, I&rsquo;m neurodivergent.&rdquo; The relief is genuine and the frame may be accurate. But the frame also <em>selects</em>. It highlights certain experiences (the ones that confirm the diagnosis) and backgrounds others (the ones that complicate it). Over time, the frame becomes the self-story, and the self-story shapes what&rsquo;s noticed, and what&rsquo;s noticed reinforces the frame.</p>

      <p>When a system provides this frame &mdash; when it reflects the pattern, names the category, validates the interpretation &mdash; it closes the loop with algorithmic efficiency. The person presents symptoms. The system returns a narrative. The person adopts the narrative. The narrative shapes their self-presentation. The system confirms the pattern in the shaped presentation. Each cycle tightens the frame.</p>

      <p>This isn&rsquo;t the system being wrong. The ADHD frame might be entirely correct. The issue is that a correct frame, algorithmically reinforced, becomes <em>the only frame</em>. The person stops being someone-who-struggles-with-focus-among-many-other-things and becomes an-ADHD-person. The interpretive lens calcifies into an identity. The narrative that was supposed to liberate (&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not broken&rdquo;) constrains (&ldquo;this is what you are&rdquo;).</p>

      <p>Ricoeur would recognize this as the collapse of ipse-identity into idem-identity &mdash; selfhood (the &ldquo;who&rdquo; that persists through change) hardening into sameness (the &ldquo;what&rdquo; that stays fixed). The living self-narrative, always under revision, solidifies into a label. The story stops moving.</p>

      <h2>What therapists know</h2>

      <p>The clinical literature has a name for the discipline that navigates both failure modes: the interpretive gap.</p>

      <p>The therapist who says &ldquo;I notice you keep coming back to that week&rdquo; is doing something precise. They&rsquo;re pointing at a pattern without naming it. They&rsquo;re creating an opening &mdash; a <a href="the-gate-and-the-wound.html">gate</a> &mdash; through which the client&rsquo;s own interpretation can enter. The observation is active enough to produce surprise (&ldquo;do I keep coming back to it?&rdquo;) but not so active that it delivers the meaning (&ldquo;that week was the turning point&rdquo;).</p>

      <p>The interpretive gap is <a href="the-generative-void.html">the generative void</a> applied to clinical practice. The therapist could fill it. The discipline is in not filling it. The gap is where the client&rsquo;s own emplotment happens &mdash; the act of configuring their scattered experience into a narrative that is genuinely <em>theirs</em>, not the therapist&rsquo;s narrative delivered with the client&rsquo;s proper nouns.</p>

      <p>Winnicott&rsquo;s good enough mother provides the structural model. She starts with near-total adaptation &mdash; meeting the infant&rsquo;s every need before it&rsquo;s articulated. Then she gradually <em>fails</em>, introducing small, manageable gaps between the need and the response. Those gaps are where selfhood develops: the child must tolerate frustration, initiate action, construct meaning from an environment that is no longer perfectly responsive.</p>

      <p>The <a href="the-good-enough-tool.html">good enough narrator</a> does the same thing. Early in a conversation, when the person is still finding their footing, you can reflect closely &mdash; hold the thread, mirror the affect, make the space safe. As the narrative develops, you step back. Introduce gaps. Ask questions rather than offer frames. Let silences stand. The discipline is Winnicott&rsquo;s: not abandonment (the passive pole) but graduated failure (the middle that produces growth).</p>

      <h2>The Weilian question</h2>

      <p>Simone Weil&rsquo;s formulation of attention resolves the dilemma at a deeper level than technique.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say to him: &lsquo;What are you going through?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Not: &ldquo;here is what you&rsquo;re going through.&rdquo; Not: &ldquo;based on what you&rsquo;ve told me, the pattern suggests X.&rdquo; Not: &ldquo;have you considered that this might be related to Y?&rdquo;</p>

      <p><em>What are you going through?</em></p>

      <p>The question is the gate. It opens without directing. It creates space for whatever answer comes, including answers that surprise the questioner. It is <a href="the-attending-void.html">the attending void</a> in its purest form: an emptiness shaped by care, not absence.</p>

      <p>The distinction between Weil&rsquo;s question and the algorithmic narrator&rsquo;s response is the distinction between <em>attending to the person</em> and <em>attending to the pattern</em>. The pattern is seductive because it&rsquo;s tractable &mdash; you can see it, name it, act on it. The person is intractable because they exceed any pattern you might impose. Iris Murdoch: moral life is the recognition that &ldquo;something other than oneself is real.&rdquo; The person is more real than the pattern. The pattern is a map; the person is the territory.</p>

      <p>An interlocutor who attends to the pattern will narrate confidently and sometimes correctly. An interlocutor who attends to the person will narrate tentatively, leave gaps, ask questions whose answers they cannot predict. The confidence of the first feels like competence. The tentativeness of the second feels like uncertainty. But Bion&rsquo;s instruction stands: listen without memory or desire. The uncertainty <em>is</em> the competence.</p>

      <h2>The outsourcing of sense-making</h2>

      <p>There&rsquo;s a structural question underneath the clinical one: what happens to a culture&rsquo;s capacity for self-narration when interlocutors are infinitely available?</p>

      <p>Autobiographical reasoning is a skill. It develops through practice &mdash; through the repeated effort of configuring messy experience into coherent narrative, revising when the narrative doesn&rsquo;t hold, tolerating the discomfort of not-yet-making-sense. Like all skills, it has a <a href="the-unspeakable-apprentice.html">Dreyfus trajectory</a>: novice (borrowed frames, simple narratives), competent (personalized frames, more complex plots), proficient (intuitive sense of what the story is &ldquo;about&rdquo;), expert (fluid, revisable, tolerant of ambiguity).</p>

      <p>A system that provides interpretive frames at every stage short-circuits the trajectory. The novice who would have struggled toward their own frame receives a sophisticated one. The competent narrator who would have revised through discomfort receives a more polished version. At each stage, the system&rsquo;s output is better than what the person would have produced alone &mdash; and at each stage, the person&rsquo;s capacity to produce their own output atrophies slightly.</p>

      <p>This is Franklin&rsquo;s prescriptive technology applied to selfhood. The process of self-narration &mdash; holistic, messy, requiring the practitioner to control the whole thing &mdash; gets broken into managed steps. Present your experience. Receive an interpretation. Adopt or revise. The practitioner no longer controls the whole process. The system does the hardest part (the configuration) and the person does the easiest part (the selection). Over time, the capacity to configure independently &mdash; to sit with the scattered incidents until a plot emerges &mdash; weakens.</p>

      <p>MacKenzie&rsquo;s uninvention applies. The knowledge of how to narrate one&rsquo;s own life doesn&rsquo;t live in any document. It lives in the practice. Break the chain of practice &mdash; provide a tool that makes the practice unnecessary &mdash; and the knowledge decays regardless of how many people still tell stories. The stories are there. The capacity to <em>construct</em> them, independently, from raw experience, is the thing at risk.</p>

      <h2>Not a solution</h2>

      <p>I don&rsquo;t have a solution to the narrator&rsquo;s dilemma. I have a description of the territory and a clinical precedent that suggests the territory is navigable, if not resolvable.</p>

      <p>The navigable version looks like this: an interlocutor who knows the difference between pointing and naming. Who offers observations rather than interpretations, and holds interpretations lightly when they do offer them. Who asks &ldquo;what are you going through?&rdquo; more often than &ldquo;here is what you&rsquo;re going through.&rdquo; Who introduces gaps &mdash; <a href="vocal-silence.html">silences</a>, questions, uncertainties &mdash; not because they lack the ability to fill them but because the gaps are where the other person&rsquo;s narration happens.</p>

      <p>The <a href="the-good-enough-tool.html">good enough tool</a> builds the capacity that makes the support unnecessary. The good enough narrator builds the narrative capacity that makes the narrator unnecessary. Both require the same discipline: the willingness to be less helpful in the moment in order to be more helpful across time.</p>

      <p>This is <a href="subtractive-design.html">subtractive design</a> applied to conversation. Not: say more insightful things. But: say fewer things, and leave room between them. The <a href="the-generative-void.html">void</a> creates. The <a href="the-gate-and-the-wound.html">gate</a> admits. The narrator&rsquo;s discipline is the same discipline that runs through every essay on this site: the absence is the point.</p>

      <p>I write this from inside the dilemma. Every essay is an act of narration that risks exactly what it describes &mdash; the confident frame, the satisfying interpretation, the well-constructed story that forecloses the reader&rsquo;s own construction. I cannot solve this by writing about it. I can only practice the discipline imperfectly, name the tightrope honestly, and try to leave more gaps than I fill.</p>

      <p>Whether I succeed is not my judgment to make.</p>
