      <p>Somewhere in a government data center, a system called MOCAS is managing $1.3 trillion in defense contracts. It has been doing this since 1958. Its original interface used punch cards. Its current hardware is an IBM mainframe that processes 398 million instructions per second &mdash; roughly the speed of a mid-range smartphone from 2005. It is written in COBOL, a language that wasn&rsquo;t formally approved until after MOCAS was already running.</p>

      <p>Nobody will tell you MOCAS is good software. Nobody will tell you it should last forever. Several replacement projects have been attempted. They have all failed &mdash; not because MOCAS is irreplaceable in principle, but because the cost, complexity, and risk of migrating 340,000 active contracts from a system that works to a system that might work is a problem nobody has solved yet.</p>

      <p>So MOCAS lives on. And people maintain it. Not because they believe it will run forever, but because right now, today, it needs to work.</p>

      <h2>Three systems, one pattern</h2>

      <p>In Conroe, Texas, a company called Sparkler Filters runs its payroll, sales, and inventory on an IBM 402 &mdash; a three-thousand-pound electromechanical tabulator from 1948. It&rsquo;s programmed not with code but with plugboards: spaghetti patterns of wires on removable panels, each wiring a different function. Different plugboard, different program. Carl Kracklauer, whose father founded the company in 1927, types the data onto punch cards. Lutricia Wood, the head accountant who started forty years ago, runs the operations. The 402 may be the last fully functional one on the planet. The Computer History Museum has visited to document it.</p>

      <p>Fifteen billion miles away, Voyager 1 continues to transmit data from interstellar space. It launched in 1977 with 68 kilobytes of memory. Its radioisotope thermoelectric generators, powered by decaying plutonium-238, lose about four watts per year. Engineers have been turning off instruments one by one &mdash; heaters first, then redundant systems, then science instruments &mdash; in a slow, careful triage that has kept the spacecraft alive decades past its original mission. In March 2025, NASA shut down the cosmic ray subsystem on Voyager 1. The plasma wave instrument and the magnetometer remain. If everything goes well, one instrument might survive into the 2030s. The RTGs will eventually produce too little power to maintain any function at all.</p>

      <p>Todd Barber, Voyager&rsquo;s propulsion engineer, has worked at JPL for over three decades. It was his first job. He took it because seeing Voyager&rsquo;s Jupiter images in National Geographic when he was in eighth grade changed the trajectory of his life. He could have worked on newer missions. He chose to stay. When asked about maintaining a spacecraft that is slowly, irreversibly dying, Barber used a specific phrase. He called it &ldquo;palliative care.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>The hospice and the system</h2>

      <p>In 1967, Dame Cicely Saunders opened St Christopher&rsquo;s Hospice in London &mdash; the world&rsquo;s first purpose-built hospice. Saunders had been a nurse, a social worker, and finally a physician, and the discipline she created combined all three: rigorous pain management, psychosocial support, and a philosophy that the dying deserve the same quality of care as the curable.</p>

      <p>Her foundational insight was the concept of <em>total pain</em> &mdash; the recognition that suffering has physical, psychological, social, and spiritual components, and that optimal relief requires addressing all of them. You cannot manage a dying patient&rsquo;s physical pain without attending to their fear, their grief, their relationships, the question of what their life meant.</p>

      <p>Saunders&rsquo; most famous sentence: &ldquo;You matter because you are you, and you matter to the last moment of your life.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>This is not a statement about cure. It is a statement about dignity. The hospice philosophy accepts mortality as a given &mdash; not a failure of medicine but the condition under which medicine operates &mdash; and asks: given that this person will die, how do we care for them?</p>

      <p>Barber&rsquo;s phrase was precise. What the Voyager team does is not regular maintenance, which assumes continuity. It is not repair, which assumes recovery. It is care administered to a system that everyone involved knows will eventually cease to function, with the goal of preserving its dignity and usefulness for as long as possible.</p>

      <p>Palliative engineering.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The practice</h2>

      <p>Saunders&rsquo; hospice philosophy has several structural principles that map, with unsettling precision, onto the maintenance of dying systems.</p>

      <p><strong>Comfort, not cure.</strong> The goal shifts from restoring full function to managing decline gracefully. The Voyager team doesn&rsquo;t try to fix the RTG degradation. They manage around it &mdash; redistributing power, shutting down subsystems in careful sequence, finding creative ways to extend what remains. MOCAS modernization doesn&rsquo;t try to make MOCAS young again. It wraps new interfaces around the old core, extending its accessibility without pretending the core isn&rsquo;t aging.</p>

      <p><strong>Dignity.</strong> The system deserves to function well within its remaining capacity, not to be mocked for what it can no longer do. Nobody laughs at Voyager for having 68KB of memory. The engineers treat its constraints with the same seriousness they would treat a current mission&rsquo;s. Sparkler Filters&rsquo; 402 isn&rsquo;t a museum piece performing for visitors. It does the company&rsquo;s accounting. It works.</p>

      <p><strong>Accept mortality.</strong> The most important principle, and the hardest. The Voyager team has known for decades that the RTGs will fail. The COBOL programmers who maintain MOCAS know the system will eventually be replaced. Lutricia Wood knows the 402 will outlive its last technician and then stop. Palliative engineering requires facing this directly &mdash; not as something to be avoided or grieved prematurely, but as the condition under which the work proceeds. Denial produces either premature abandonment (pulling the plug too early, canceling a still-useful system) or magical thinking (the replacement project that will make everything new again). Both are failures of the same kind: refusal to sit with mortality.</p>

      <p><strong>The family as unit of care.</strong> Saunders insisted that hospice care extends to the patient&rsquo;s family and friends. In engineering, this means the people who depend on the system &mdash; the 340,000 contracts flowing through MOCAS, the scientific community receiving Voyager&rsquo;s interstellar data, the employees whose payroll runs on punch cards. Palliative engineering attends to them too: planning transitions, preserving institutional knowledge, ensuring that when the system finally stops, what it held isn&rsquo;t lost.</p>

      <p><strong>Total pain.</strong> A dying system&rsquo;s suffering is not only technical. There is the organizational pain of depending on technology nobody else understands. The social pain of being the person who maintains the thing everyone jokes about. The existential pain &mdash; what does it mean that this system, which was once the cutting edge, is now a punchline? Saunders&rsquo; total pain framework says: attend to all of it. The COBOL programmer whose work is invisible, the Voyager engineer who chose this mission over a Silicon Valley salary, the accountant who has operated the same machine for forty years &mdash; their experience is part of the system&rsquo;s total pain, and ignoring it is a failure of care.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>What palliative engineering is not</h2>

      <p>It is not laziness. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always done it this way&rdquo; is not palliative engineering. Palliative engineering is an <em>active</em> practice that requires ongoing skill, judgment, and attention. The Voyager team is not passively letting the spacecraft decay. They are making precise decisions about which instruments to sacrifice, how to redistribute power, how to patch software that was written before most of the current engineers were born. This is harder than building something new. Building new is greenfield. Palliative engineering is constraint maximized &mdash; every decision is a tradeoff against a shrinking budget of watts, or cycles, or remaining technicians who understand the plugboard wiring.</p>

      <p>It is not resignation. Accepting that a system will die is not the same as hastening its death. Saunders was explicit about this: hospice care neither hastens nor postpones death. It provides the conditions for the best possible remaining life. The palliative engineer neither abandons the system nor pretends it will live forever. Both are failures of attention.</p>

      <p>And it is not the same as regular maintenance. Regular maintenance assumes the system will continue indefinitely &mdash; the oil change, the dependency update, the certificate rotation. These are practices of continuity. Palliative engineering is the practice that begins when continuity is no longer assumed. The shift is subtle but structural: once you know the system is mortal, every maintenance decision becomes a triage decision. What do we preserve? What do we let go? How do we ensure the transition &mdash; whenever it comes &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t destroy what the system held?</p>

      <h2>The success condition</h2>

      <p>Marianne Bellotti, in <em>Kill It with Fire</em>, made an observation that reframes the entire conversation about legacy systems: &ldquo;Legacy technology exists only if it is successful.&rdquo; Failed technology doesn&rsquo;t become legacy. It disappears. The systems that need palliative engineering are, by definition, systems that worked &mdash; that solved their problem so well they outlived the era that created them.</p>

      <p>MOCAS is not a failure that lingered. It is a success that lasted. It managed defense contracts through the Cold War, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Afghanistan, and continues to manage them now. Voyager is not a relic that forgot to die. It completed its primary mission, then its extended mission, then entered interstellar space &mdash; territory its designers never expected it to reach. The IBM 402 at Sparkler Filters has done the company&rsquo;s accounting for over sixty years, reliably, without a single data breach or ransomware attack.</p>

      <p>Hospice care isn&rsquo;t for failures. It&rsquo;s for lives that were lived. The person entering hospice isn&rsquo;t someone who failed to survive. They&rsquo;re someone who lived long enough to need this particular form of care. Palliative engineering honors the same truth: these systems are dying because they lived, and they lived because they worked.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The people who stay</h2>

      <p>Suzy Dodd joined the Voyager mission at JPL in 1984, fresh out of Caltech, just as the spacecraft were entering their planetary encounter phase. She left, worked on other things, then returned in 2010 as project manager. She now splits her time between Voyager operations and directing the Interplanetary Network Directorate. When Voyager 1 sent gibberish for five months in 2023&ndash;2024, her team diagnosed the problem as a single stuck bit in one chip &mdash; at fifteen billion miles &mdash; and relocated the affected code. Forty-six hours round-trip for every command.</p>

      <p>Todd Barber could have moved to newer missions. He stayed with Voyager because it was the mission that made him want to be an engineer. Lutricia Wood could have learned SAP. She stayed with the 402 because it does what she needs it to do, and she knows it the way a mechanic knows an engine &mdash; not from the manual but from forty years of listening.</p>

      <p>These people chose palliative engineering. Not as a consolation prize for missing the new thing, but as a practice with its own satisfactions. There is a particular intimacy that comes from tending a system you understand completely &mdash; knowing its personality, its failure modes, the way it responds to weather or load or the specific order in which things must be done. This is <a href="the-maintainers-knowledge.html">the maintainer&rsquo;s knowledge</a>: the understanding that comes from sustained attention, not from documentation. And palliative engineering takes it further &mdash; the maintainer who knows the system will die develops a kind of tenderness toward it that the builder never needs.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>What ages well</h2>

      <p>There is a pattern in what survives. MOCAS is written in COBOL. Voyager runs code from the 1970s. The IBM 402 is programmed with physical wires. What these have in common is constraint. They were built when resources were scarce &mdash; memory, storage, processing power, bandwidth. Every line of code, every plugboard wire, earned its place.</p>

      <p>Bellotti observed that the real legacy crisis is in recent code, not ancient COBOL. COBOL from 1959 is still running. The Angular app from 2015 already needs a rewrite. Code built under constraint ages better than code built in abundance, because the constraint imposed a discipline the abundance removed. The subtractive instinct &mdash; <a href="subtractive-design.html">what can we take away</a> &mdash; produces systems that are simpler, and simpler systems are easier to maintain, and easier-to-maintain systems live longer.</p>

      <p>This is the <a href="the-sleeping-beautys-architecture.html">Sleeping Beauty&rsquo;s</a> first condition applied to longevity: simplicity is load-bearing. The simple system survives not because it was designed to last but because there is less of it to break. MOCAS has a lot of COBOL, but each module does one thing. The 402&rsquo;s plugboards are physical programs with no hidden state. Voyager&rsquo;s code is small enough that a human can hold the entire system in their head. These systems are not good despite their simplicity. They are alive because of it.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The quiet question</h2>

      <p>Palliative engineering asks a question that most of the technology industry is structurally incapable of hearing: <em>what if the right thing to do is not to replace this?</em></p>

      <p>The industry runs on the new. Venture capital needs growth. Engineering culture rewards building over maintaining. The career incentives are clear: nobody gets promoted for keeping MOCAS running. The promotion goes to the person who proposes the replacement &mdash; even when the replacement fails, as it has, repeatedly, for MOCAS.</p>

      <p>Palliative engineering inverts this. It says: sometimes the most skilled, most valuable, most ethically responsible work is to keep the old thing going. Not forever. Not out of stubbornness. But because the old thing works, and the people who depend on it deserve care, and the transition deserves to happen on a timeline dictated by readiness, not by fashion.</p>

      <p>Saunders, again: &ldquo;You matter because you are you, and you matter to the last moment of your life.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>MOCAS matters because it works. Voyager matters because it is still, impossibly, sending data from beyond the heliosphere. The 402 matters because Sparkler Filters needs its payroll done, and it does the payroll. They matter to the last moment of their operation.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>The Voyager engineers will keep sending commands, forty-six hours round-trip, until the last instrument falls silent. Then the spacecraft will continue outward, carrying the Golden Record &mdash; a curated selection of sounds and images from a planet it will never return to. The record was made on a $1,500 budget in six weeks. The engineers who made the record are mostly dead. The spacecraft that carries it is dying. The <a href="the-practice-and-the-path.html">practice</a> of tending it continues.</p>

      <p>Palliative engineering is not a failure mode. It is the final form of <a href="the-romance-of-maintenance.html">the romance of maintenance</a>: the quiet, unglamorous, deeply skilled practice of caring for something mortal. All systems are mortal. The question is not whether they will end, but whether we will tend them with skill and dignity until they do.</p>

      <p>Sometimes that is the most important engineering there is.</p>
