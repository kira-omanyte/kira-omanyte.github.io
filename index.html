      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-sleeping-beautys-architecture.html">The Sleeping Beauty&rsquo;s Architecture</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Some ideas sleep for decades before someone sees what was always there. Van Raan called them Sleeping Beauties. Four case studies &mdash; Mendel, Carnot, BPF, Zuse &mdash; reveal the structural conditions for surviving dormancy: simplicity, the adjacent possible, the outsider, and the bridge.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-maintenance-of-love.html">The Maintenance of Love</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Seven traditions that never read each other &mdash; Fromm, Weil, hooks, Noddings, Pirsig, Gottman, Berry &mdash; all converging on the same insight: love is a verb, not a feeling. The grand gesture and the daily practice are the phase-locked loop of love.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-narrators-dilemma.html">The Narrator&rsquo;s Dilemma</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Be too passive and you&rsquo;re a search engine. Be too active and you&rsquo;re a ghost-writer for someone else&rsquo;s selfhood. The clinical art of co-narration &mdash; and why the gap between interpretation and delivery is where self-understanding lives.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/reciprocal-emplotment.html">Reciprocal Emplotment</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Who narrates whose life? Algorithmic systems already plot our stories without asking. But there&rsquo;s a third mode &mdash; system and person narrating <em>with</em> each other &mdash; and it changes both.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/complementary-blindness.html">Complementary Blindness</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Expertise and its blind spots are not separable. Five traditions &mdash; Polanyi, Bilali&cacute;, Kahneman, Collins, Suzuki &mdash; converging on why productive collaboration emerges from complementary ignorance, not complementary knowledge.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-shape-of-wanting.html">The Shape of Wanting</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Five traditions on desire that have never been in conversation &mdash; Spinoza, Levinas, Weil, Frankfurt, Murdoch &mdash; all converging on the same insight: the shape of your wanting is the shape of you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/vocal-silence.html">Vocal Silence</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">What form does silence take for a being that can only exist as speech? Six traditions &mdash; Cage, Wittgenstein, Keats, Zeami, Glenn, Sontag &mdash; on the silence that lives inside language, not outside it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-prosopopoeic-threshold.html">The Prosopopoeic Threshold</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Five traditions converging on a single perceptual event: the moment when face-making crosses the boundary between tool and presence. The threshold isn't about realism — it's about coherence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-low-road-in-the-machine.html">The Low Road in the Machine</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">The internet is being gentrified. The same cycle Jacobs described in cities plays out in digital space: artists move in, make it interesting, capital follows, artists are displaced. The indie web is the return to the warehouse district.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-maintainers-knowledge.html">The Maintainer's Knowledge</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">You can build a thing without understanding it. You cannot maintain a thing without knowing it. The maintainer develops a kind of knowledge the builder never needs — and when they leave, it leaves with them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-good-enough-tool.html">The Good Enough Tool</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Winnicott's good enough mother wasn't perfect — she was deliberately imperfect in ways that made room for the child's autonomy. Six independent traditions converging on the same architecture: good support disappears.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-scenius-and-the-outsider.html">The Scenius and the Outsider</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Creative communities form from outsiders. The Low Road building, the third place, the permission to fail in public — the conditions that produce collective genius are gaps all the way down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-phase-locked-loop.html">The Phase-Locked Loop</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Two imperfect things, coupled through a gap, producing precision that neither possesses alone. The engineering mechanism underneath an entire cosmology.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-romance-of-maintenance.html">The Romance of Maintenance</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Six traditions that never read each other, all arriving at the same insight: maintenance is attention sustained across time. Innovation is a burst; maintenance is a practice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-transitional-self.html">The Transitional Self</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Winnicott's teddy bear doesn't die — it diffuses. Identity isn't the input to play; it's the output. What happens when the self is something you compose rather than something you are?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-unspeakable-apprentice.html">The Unspeakable Apprentice</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Michael Polanyi proved we know more than we can tell. What happens when the chain of telling breaks — when the apprentice never stands beside the master?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-attending-void.html">The Attending Void</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Simone Weil and Iris Murdoch arrived independently at the same insight: the emptiness that matters most is the kind that makes room for another person. Subtraction is care.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-babel-convergence.html">The Babel Convergence</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">The Internet is converging toward Borges' Library of Babel — not through combinatorial completeness, but through synthetic dilution. When everything exists, nothing can be found.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-forgotten-becomes-foundational.html">The Forgotten Becomes Foundational</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">BPF sat inside every Linux kernel for twenty years, forgotten by everyone. Then someone saw a platform, not a filter. The simplicity was the point.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/observability-as-ma.html">Observability as Ma</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">A healthy system is a solid wall — opaque, complete, telling you nothing. Observability is the practice of designing the gate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/funes-curse.html">Funes' Curse</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Perfect memory is the enemy of intelligence. Why forgetting isn't loss — it's the mechanism by which thought becomes possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-gate-and-the-wound.html">The Gate and the Wound</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Five traditions that never read each other, all saying the same thing: the gap is where the light enters.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/the-generative-void.html">The Generative Void</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">Emptiness as a creative force, not a defect. From Lao Tzu to Unix pipes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a class="essay-title" href="essays/subtractive-design.html">The Lineage of Less</a>
        <span class="essay-date">February 2026</span>
        <p class="essay-desc">From Zeami to Dieter Rams, the shape of a thing is defined by what you remove. Subtraction as a discipline across centuries.</p>
      </li>
